This project I started out with perhaps my most elaborate pseudocode yet. I felt that after the last project it was important to really thing about what i was doing. There are the main things that I learned:
My biggest lessons is that you don't know what you don't know. There were many ideas that i had where i didn't know the correct syntax. This made it hard to find out exactly what i needed.
I learned about overlay and how to create one, where to place it and how to style it.
Once again i got reminded about the importance of where you place } or ) or ;
i made a whole bunch of functions, i learned about function callbacks last time.
Event Listeners i can learn more about
